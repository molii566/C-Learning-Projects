C-Learning-Projects

This repository contains small C programming projects I’ve worked on while learning the language.
Each project helps me practice different concepts in C, from basic syntax to more advanced topics. 🖥️
What's Inside:

    📝 Simple programs and exercises to strengthen my C skills.
    ⚙️ Projects ranging from basic apps to more complex algorithms.
    💾 Code examples covering topics like memory management, pointers, and file handling.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute. I’ll keep adding more projects as I continue learning! 🚀
